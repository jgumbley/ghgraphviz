Github Graphviz
-----------------------------------

Some tools for visualising the structure of repos and
users from data available via the Github API.

Depends on the alphagov/ghtools project.
 
Split into two parts:
    - Grab data from GitHub API and put into a 
      serialised format.
    - Process serialised format to generate graph.

Usage:
